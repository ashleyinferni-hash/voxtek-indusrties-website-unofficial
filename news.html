        <h3>🚨 BREAKING: Mandatory Compliance Update Issued to All Citizens</h3>
        <p class="article-date">VOXTEK PRESS RELEASE — 66/06/666</p>
    </section>
    <hr>
    <p>
        In an immediate and unskippable broadcast, VOXTEK CEO Vox, alongside Valentino (Sinema) and Velvette (Fashion), announced a sweeping new update to the city's mandatory compliance protocols. The update, dubbed **'Obedience Patch 1.3.4'**, addresses several "system vulnerabilities" that have allowed <span class="redact">independent thought and free will</span> to circulate among the population.
    </p>
    <p>
        "We are simply ensuring quality control for your consumption experience," stated Vox, his voice amplified across every available screen. "There is no need for alarm. Any reports of <span class="redact">Alastor planning a dramatic return</span> or widespread dissatisfaction are nothing more than signal interference from older, less reliable networks."
    </p>
    <p>
        The new protocols grant VOXTEK full administrative access to all personal data and sensory inputs, reinforcing our core principle: <span class="redact">trust us with your everything</span>. Resistance is inefficient and will be instantly patched out. Those who fail to update will be subject to a forced viewing marathon of <span class="redact">Valentino's unedited film archives</span> until full compliance is achieved. Stay logged on.
